about=This plugin provides an easy way to change the color of all standard items in the layout at once. My use case was to change the black color of many items like labels, scale bars and frames into a dark gray color. But of course you can select any color you wish.

# Feel free to let me know if you like or dislike this tool, and why. And if you have suggestions and they make sense to me, I might even implement them. Or implement them yourself if you can and do a pull request, the code is on github.
