description=Turn black items in composer into gray (or any other color).

about=This plugin provides an easy way to change the color of all standard items in the map composer at once. My wish was to change the black color of many items like labels, scale bars and frames into a dark gray color. But of course you can set those to any color you wish.

# Feel free to let me know if you like or dislike this tool, and why. And if you have suggestions and they make sense to me, I might even implement them. Or implement them yourself if you can, the code is on github.
